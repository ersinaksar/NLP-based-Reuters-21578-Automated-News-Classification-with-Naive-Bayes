# Text-Classification
I distinguished which tweets were sent on Twitter data and which did not contain profanity.
Text Classification was performed on routers data set with Naive Bayes. The data was cleared in a way that only one of the 5 main headings was selected, or any other topics in the additional data set, was trained and 93% accuracy was obtained. 
My tech stack, Python, BERT,  Jupyter Notebook,  Anaconda
